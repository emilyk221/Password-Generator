# Password Genetator

## Description

This password generator returns a random password that is generated based on user-input criteria including the number of characters and what type of characters (lowercase, uppercase, numeric & special) to be included. The user responses are validated to ensure that a number between 8 and 128 is chosen for length of the password and that at least one character type is chosen to be included. The password generator will choose characters from each character type chosen to be included and leave out the character types not chosen to be included.

Being able to generate a random password based on specific criteria makes it easy to produce a password that is both secure/strong and will meet certain requirements or guidelines.
